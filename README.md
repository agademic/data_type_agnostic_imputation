# Data type agnostic imputation in data frames

In this Thesis we explore the performance of ‘sockeye’, a transformer based Neural Machine Translation model for data type imputation of missing values in heterogeneous tables. Therefore, we conduct experiments on several different datasets with different types of missingness. Our results show, that a transformer-based model, can impute missing values without prior knowledge of the data types and performs on par with baseline methods for missing value imputation.
